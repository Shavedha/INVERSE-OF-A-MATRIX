# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
Import numpy as np
### Step 2: 
Enter the rows of the matrix for which the inverse is to be found
### Step 3: 
Use (np.linalg.inv(A)) to find the inverse of the matrix. 
### Step 4: 
Print the value

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: Shavedha
#RegisterNumber:21500429
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
print(np.linalg.inv(A))
```

## Output:
